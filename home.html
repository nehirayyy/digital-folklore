    <h2 id="subtitle2">Crowdsourced and Professionally Monitored </h2>

    <div class="webFrame" id="frame3">
        <img src="imgs/webFrame.png" alt="">
        <p id="bodyodyody3">The participatory meme encyclopedia that is KYM is created by the submissions of the users, as well as professional editors & writers in the team who monitor and fact-check everything (Walker). This co-creation with the users and the monitors also means that they have to agree on the necessarily liberal definitions of "a meme", which is often a point of disputation in this dynamic. The "this is not a meme!" mark of the user has given birth to the "deadpool" entry â€“marked as insufficiently researched or known in the community.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="subtitle3">Confirmed or Denied</h2>

    <div class="webFrame" id="frame4">
        <img src="imgs/webFrame.png" alt="">
        <p id="bodyodyody4">This excecutive decision of the moderator intrigued me to see if time and era had a role in the decision. I had the question "Are memes from a certain time more likely to be disqualified?" So naturally, I only considered the memes that were decided upon: Confirmed or Deadpooled. You can filter out the categories to search for a trend. However, I found the mix to be quite uniform.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="subtitle4">User Response to the Qualification System</h2>

    <div class="webFrame" id="frame5">
        <img src="imgs/webFrame.png" alt="" height="700px">
        <p id="bodyodyody5">This chart reveals that Confirmed memes drive much more engagement compared to the Submission and Deadpool categories.As demonstrated earlier in the Status Count graph, Confirmed memes can be considered rare in comparison to Submission memes. They even have their <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/confirmed?sort=newest">very own page</a>  on the archive. This points to the possibility that their rarity and spotlight may be the cause of their popularity. Memes that catch the attention of the moderators are likely already engaging, which could explain their higher view counts post-confirmation. <br>
        However, the Confirmed and Deadpool columns suggest that the views that a meme gets is tied to its intrinsic humor value rather than the mere fact of their confirmation by a moderation team.
        <br>
        On the other hand, "Deadpool" memes, marked as lacking in relevance or research, see far fewer views. This suggests that users pay attention to these quality markers when deciding which content to engage with.
        <br> 
        Overall, the chart highlights the strong correlation between confirmation and increased meme engagement and not meme disqualification.
